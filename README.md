# Intermediate_Android_Development_Project_Week_Kickoff_Part2
Advences Music Player

Your project spans an entire week. Your project instructions this week are closer to a Sprint Challenge than an afternoon Challenge in that they are sparse.

Treat this week like you're building this application at a company. Your client is your instructor. Your project managers (including your section lead) are your main support throughout the week.

The main objective of this week is to develop the minimum viable product (MVP) feature set listed below using the techniques, skills, and technologies you've studied here at Lambda.

This project is open-ended. After you finish the requirement set listed below, spend your remaining time debugging and testing your product and implementing extra features, either suggestions listed below or those you come up with yourself. Run your ideas through a PM or your section lead and have them approve it before you get too creative. They're there to help you stay on task, on time, and deliver a product.

Remember: it's more important to deliver a working well-tested product than it is to have flashy but incomplete features.

Requirements
You must implement each of these requirements in your application:

Your user can Play, Skip, Pause,and go back on their playlist.
Your user can Save their favorite songs on a separate file
Use waht you have learned on UI to perfect the 2nd activity
allow user to upload their own music
play music from the web

Once music is selected from playlist user are taken to another activity that allows them to control play, skip, paus buttons.

Extra Requirements
After finishing your required app elements, you are not finished with your project. We expect you to implement at least three extra features. You're at liberty to choose the features you'd like to implement.
These extra requirements (or others you come up with on your own) are not necessarily things you have learned throughout the course. Treat them as if your client adds a feature at a late date that you don't already know how to implement. How will you go about learning how to bring that feature into your product?

A few ideas are as follows:

Use different UI and graphic to perfect the app
Look up at the competitive similer app to see what their are doing great
add login information for user
share musics on social media


Commit History
Commit your code often and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and anyone you're working with.

Commit regularly when you've made a complete and quantifiable change to your code. There is no set amount of time that should happen or amount of code written between commits; simply use your best judgement. Adding new features. Fixing a bug. A good rule to follow is if what you've done can't be summarized in about 50 characters, you may have gone too long before committing. If you are committing more than one change at once, you're not committing often enough.

Your PMs will check that you are committing regularly, with clear and understandable commit messages.

Work Alone
You project week project is an individual effort. Your work is your own and your classmates are responsible for their own project time as well. Your application reflects your proficiency as a developer and your command of the concepts and techniques in the first iOS Unit.

The twenty minute rule continues to apply. Seek help from your PM or Section Lead if you run into problems that are keeping you from moving forward or leading you towards a mire you'll get bogged down in. Your team is there to help you. Just make sure you give your fellow students the space they need to succeed, too.

Planning
Design your interfaces and schedule your time carefully. Keep your scope narrow and focused. Even though you have a week to work in, there's a lot of work to do and you need to make sure you're moving forward with good progress with an end in sight and will have a completed application to present.

Thoroughly test and debug your application well before it's time to present it. Stick to your schedule and make sure that testing and refinement is part of that schedule.

Remember: Simpler and working is better than fancy and unfinished.
